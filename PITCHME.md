## Git services: GitLab beats GitHub

Git is great! Long live Git! (Well, until the next **Even Better** VCS!)

On the other hand:
* You need a safe place off-site to store your files.
* You want to share some of them with (some) friends.
* You want to show off your work, especially if your next job is going to be better!
* Your employer doesn't want to pay you to maintain the servers and software, and pay more to back it all up.

Git services to the rescue!

Free Git services are great for many purposes!
