## Git: What else do you need?

* A safe place off-site to store your files.
* Share (some of) them with (some) friends.
* Show off your work, especially if your next job is going to be better!
* Your employer pays you for code-writing, not to maintain  servers and software.

## Git services to the rescue!

## Free Git services are great for many purposes!
