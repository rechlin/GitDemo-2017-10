## What else do you need besides Git?

* A safe place off-site to store your files.
* Share (some of) them with (some) friends.
* Show off your work, especially if your next job is going to be better!
* Your employer doesn't want to pay you to maintain the servers and software, and pay more to back it all up.

## Git services to the rescue!
