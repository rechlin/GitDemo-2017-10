### Git is great! 
### Long live Git! 

Git: What else could you possibly need?

---
### I'm glad you asked!

* Safe storage off-site
* Private repos for private code
* Show off your work!
* Your boss wants you coding, not fixing servers and backups

### Git services to the rescue!

#### In the beginning
### There was GitHub

* Free for Open Source
* Forking and Pull requests
* Expensive for private code
* Few features
* Little competition

---
### Git Services Today

* GitLab
  * Full workflow to Continuous Deployment (CD)
  * Matches all of GitHub's new features
* Bit Bucket (Atlassian)
  * Integrates with JIRA and their other tools
  * Onsite or SaaS
* GitHub Today

  * Docs generated online
  * Third party plugins
  * Onsite version to match GitLab's
